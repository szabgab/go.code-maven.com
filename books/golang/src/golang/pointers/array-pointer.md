# Array Pointer


Just as with variables holding integers, variables holding arrays are also copied dirng assignment. Here too you can use
a pointer to have two ways to access the same array.


* Assigning an array creates a copy of the data.
* One can assign a pointer and then both variables access the same place in memory.
