# Exercise: Selector with list of items from a file

* Write a program that will get a file on the command line.
* It will display a menu allowing the user to select item by selecting the number next to it.
* e.g. the file looks like this:

```
blue
yellow
green
black
```

The menu should look like this:

```
1) blue
2) yellow
3) green
4) black
```

* The user then can select a number (e.g. 3) and the program prints "green".
* Make sure the program handles well if the input is invalid.
