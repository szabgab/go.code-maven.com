# Exercise: ROT13 on file

* write a program that will accept the name of a file and replace it with the [ROT13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13) encoded version of the text.
* Encode each letter a-z and A-Z, but leave everything else intact.
* If written correctly, running the program again on the same file should convert it back to the original version.
