# Hello Bar - Printf

* Printf
* %s


When printing values of variables it might be better to use the Printf function than the Println as the former allows us to use placeholders
such as `%s` and be more precise where we would want to put a space and where don't.
These formatting placeholders are similar to what we have in other programming languages, but Go has a few additional placeholders.
Specifically `%s` isn't special. It stands for strings.
