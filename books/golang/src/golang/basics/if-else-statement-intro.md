# if else statement

* if
* else


We'll have a longer discussion about conditinal statements later, but it is quite hard to do anything useful without them so let's have a quick look at an `if - else` construct. Here we check if the value in the `name` variable equals to the string `Go` and depending on the success of this comparision we print something.
