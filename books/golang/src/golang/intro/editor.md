In order to write some Go program you will need a text editor. You can use Notepad++ on Windows or vim or emacs anywhere, but the recommended editor is the Visual Studio Code of Microsoft using the Go plugins. You can download it from the link bellow.

When you open your first file with a .go extension it will offer you to install the plugins. Let it install everything it wants to.
At the end you might need to restarted the IDE.
