# Build Hello World exe


If you'd like to crete a distributable version of your code you can type `go build` and the name of your file. That will create an executable
with the same name (just without the extension). This is specific to the Operating System and platform you currently use. Later we'll see how



```
go build hello_world.go
./hello_world
```
