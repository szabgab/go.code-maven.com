# Exercise: read several files

Given several files where each file contains two numbers separated by a comma,
print out the result of dividing the first number by the second number.
e.g. 

```
go run read_several_files.go a.txt b.txt c.txt d.txt
```

should work.

{% embed include file="src/examples/read-several-files/a.txt" %}
{% embed include file="src/examples/read-several-files/c.txt" %}
{% embed include file="src/examples/read-several-files/d.txt" %}
