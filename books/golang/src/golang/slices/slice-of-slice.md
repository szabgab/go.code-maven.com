# Slice of a slice


We can take a slice of a slice. It is just another, most likely smaller, window on the same array in the background.


{% embed include file="src/examples/slice-of-slice/slice_of_slice.go" %}
{% embed include file="src/examples/slice-of-slice/slice_of_slice.out" %}

* This would work on arrays as well: Slices of an array
