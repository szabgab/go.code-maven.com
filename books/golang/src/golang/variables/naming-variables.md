# Variables - Naming

* Lower-case variables are scoped to the current package.
* Upper-case variables are exported from the package and globally visible.
* Block-scoped variables (e.g. in a function) are only visible in the block.

* [camelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) for private name
* [PascalCase](https://wiki.c2.com/?PascalCase) for public names

* Special case when part of the name is an acronym:
* `theURL`
* `theHTML`
