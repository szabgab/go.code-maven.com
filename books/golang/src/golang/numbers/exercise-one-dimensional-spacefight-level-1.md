# Exercise: One-dimensional spacefight - level 1

* This is the first level of a game we are going to build.
* You are in the one-dimensional space where you only have distance, but no direction. There is an enemy spaceship you need to shoot down. The distance of the spaceship is represented as an integer number. You shoot by typing in an integer number. 


* The computer "thinks" of a number between 1-20 and the user can guess it. (The computer asks the user for a guess).
* Then the computer tells the user if the guess was correct or if it was smaller or larger than the chosen number.

* In the higher levels of this game the user will be able to guess several times, but for now let's start with this simple version.
