# Exercise: ROT13

Implement a function that given a string will return its [ROT13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13) encryption
and given the encrypted string will return the original string. Characters that are not letters
will remain the same.

e.g. "hello World!" is converted to "Uryyb Jbeyq!"
